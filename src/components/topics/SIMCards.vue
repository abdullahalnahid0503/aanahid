    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      Fast, affordable, and easy to set up. Internet in Malaysia is generally reliable and cheap. Most students rely on mobile data instead of home broadband in their first months. Here are some popular prepaid plans from the major operators that balance price, data, and coverage.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white text-center mt-6"><U><strong>U Mobile</strong></U></h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">Great for students on a budget. U Mobile is popular because its prepaid plans give a lot of data for everyday use without being expensive. They offer unlimited data with a fair usage policy, which means speeds may slow after heavy use. Coverage is strong in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, and major cities, and reasonably stable in semi-rural areas.</p>
    <ul class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside">
      <li>RM25 per month: Unlimited data up to 12 Mbps after fair usage, unlimited calls, and SMS. Good for browsing and social media.</li>
      <li>RM35 per month: Higher speeds up to 12 Mbps, unlimited calls and SMS, suitable for streaming and online classes.</li>
      <li>RM40 to RM50 per month: Larger data quota, faster speeds, hotspot included for sharing with laptops or tablets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white text-center mt-6"><U><strong>CelcomDigi</strong></U></h2>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white text-center mt-6"><U><strong>Tips for Students</strong></U></h2>
    <ul class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Unlimited data usually has a fair usage policy, so speeds may slow after a certain threshold.</li>
      <li>Some plans last for months so you don’t have to top up every month.</li>
      <li>Keep your number active. If you do not top up for around 90 days, your SIM may be cancelled, and you could lose access to verification codes for banking and eWallets.</li>
      <li>Most Malaysian SIMs come with roaming enabled, but charges apply if you use them abroad.</li>
    </ul>
