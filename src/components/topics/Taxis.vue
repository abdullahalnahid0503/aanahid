      <u><strong>Ride-Hailing & Taxis: Know Your Options</strong></u>
    </h1>

    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      Ride-hailing is a major part of daily life in Malaysia, especially for students and newcomers. Each platform works differently, and choosing the right one can save you money, time, and stress.
    </p>

    <!-- Grab -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 text-center">
      <u><strong>Grab - Most Reliable and Widely Used</strong></u>
    </h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      Grab is the dominant ride-hailing platform in Malaysia and is generally considered the safest and most reliable option.
      Grab has strict driver registration, real-time tracking, emergency assistance, and trip history records. The app is easy to use and widely accepted across Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Penang, Johor, and most major cities.
      Prices are higher compared to other platforms, especially during peak hours, bad weather, or late at night. Surge pricing is common, but service quality is consistent.

    <!-- inDrive -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 text-center">
      <u><strong>inDrive - Cheapest Option with Price Negotiation</strong></u>
    </h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      inDrive works differently from Grab. Instead of accepting a fixed price, you propose how much you want to pay, and drivers choose whether to accept it.
      This often results in cheaper rides, especially for long distances or during peak hours. Many students use inDrive to save money.
      However, safety standards depend heavily on the individual driver. While the app shows ratings and trip details, it does not enforce the same level of control as Grab.
      Always share your ride details with a friend and avoid using inDrive late at night if you are unfamiliar with the area.

    <!-- Bolt -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 text-center">
      <u><strong>Bolt - Newer Option with Competitive Pricing</strong></u>
    </h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      Bolt has started operating in selected parts of Malaysia and is expanding gradually. It is well known internationally for its affordable pricing and simple interface.
      Prices are usually lower than Grab and more predictable than inDrive. However, driver availability is still limited in many areas, especially outside city centers.
      Bolt can be a good alternative when Grab prices surge and inDrive has no available drivers.

    <!-- Maxim -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 text-center">
      <u><strong>Maxim - Very Cheap but Use with Caution</strong></u>
    </h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      Maxim is one of the cheapest ride-hailing platforms in Malaysia. It is commonly used by students who prioritize cost over comfort.
      Prices are often significantly lower than those of Grab. However, vehicle quality, driver professionalism, and customer support can vary widely.
      Maxim is best used for short daytime trips in familiar areas. It is not recommended for late-night travel or urgent situations.
