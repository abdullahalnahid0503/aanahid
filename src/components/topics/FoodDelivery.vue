      <u><strong>GrabFood - Most Reliable and Widely Used Food Delivery Platform</strong></u>
    </h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      GrabFood is the most popular and widely used food delivery service in Malaysia, making it a safe and reliable choice, especially for new students and first-time users. It operates seamlessly within the Grab app, which many students already use for transport and payments.
      The platform offers the largest restaurant network in the country, covering international fast food chains, local eateries, cafés, and campus-area vendors. Its delivery coverage is strong across Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Johor, Penang, and most student-dense locations.
      GrabFood frequently provides vouchers, bundle deals, and free delivery promotions. When paired with GrabPay or Touch n Go eWallet, overall costs can become competitive despite slightly higher base prices.
      Delivery performance is generally consistent, and customer support is responsive in cases of missing items or delivery delays.

      <u><strong>Foodpanda - Strong Alternative with Late-Night Coverage</strong></u>
    </h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      Foodpanda is the second most widely used food delivery platform in Malaysia and serves as a strong alternative to GrabFood, particularly in urban areas. It is well integrated into student life, especially during late-night study sessions or exam periods.
      The platform is known for its late-night delivery availability and frequent promotional vouchers. While menu prices can sometimes be higher, Foodpanda offsets this through discount codes, subscription plans, and flash deals.
      Restaurant availability varies by location, but in certain areas, Foodpanda offers better access to local and independent food vendors compared to competitors.
      Customer support is generally dependable, although response times may slow during peak ordering hours.

      <u><strong>ShopeeFood - Cheapest Option with Aggressive Discounts</strong></u>
    </h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      ShopeeFood has expanded rapidly in Malaysia by focusing on affordability and aggressive discount strategies, making it especially attractive to students and budget-conscious users.
      The platform frequently offers lower prices than GrabFood and Foodpanda, particularly when using ShopeePay. Users benefit from free delivery offers, stackable vouchers, cashback, and daily promotional deals.
      Coverage is strongest in Kuala Lumpur and other major cities, while availability in smaller towns may be limited. Delivery times can be slower during peak demand, but the cost savings often outweigh the wait.
      ShopeeFood is ideal for users prioritising price over speed.

      <u><strong>Bekal by foodpanda - Malaysia’s First End-to-End Halal Certified Food Delivery</strong></u>
    </h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
      Bekal by foodpanda is Malaysia’s first food delivery service designed with full halal integrity from start to finish, making it a trusted option for Muslim consumers. It operates directly within the regular foodpanda app, so users don’t need a separate platform.
      The service only delivers food from halal-certified restaurants, handled by specially trained riders who use dedicated delivery bags. These riders and processes are aligned with JAKIM halal requirements, ensuring no cross-contamination throughout the delivery journey.
      Bekal stands out by focusing exclusively on halal vendors rather than offering mixed options. This removes uncertainty for users who prioritise strict halal compliance and want peace of mind when ordering food.
